    <h1>❄️ Welcome to the Wildlife of Antarctica! 🐧</h1>
    <br>
    <p><i>Antarctica may seem like a frozen, lifeless place—but it’s actually home to some of the most amazing 
    animals on Earth!<br> From the icy land to the cold, deep ocean, a variety of creatures
    have adapted to survive in these extreme conditions<br><br>🧊 On land and sea ice, you’ll find penguins like the Emperor 
    and Adélie, waddling in groups and diving for fish. 
    <br>Seals such as the Weddell, Leopard, and Crabeater rest on the ice and swim beneath it in search of food.<br>
    🌊 In the freezing Southern Ocean, massive whales like the Blue Whale and Orca glide 
    through the water,<br> feeding on tiny shrimp-like creatures called krill—which are the base of the entire Antarctic food web.<br>
    🪲 While you won’t see many insects, a few tiny land animals, like springtails and mites,
     live in the soil and mosses during the short summer.<br><br>
    Every animal here plays an important role in this frozen ecosystem.<br> Take a look around to learn more about each species, 
    where they live, what they eat, and how they survive in one of the harshest places on Earth!</i></p>
    <br>
    <h3>Lets take a look at the animals we see here!</h3>

    <h3>🐧 Emperor Penguin</h3>
    <img src="emperor.jpg">
    <p><b>The Emperor Penguin is the tallest and heaviest penguin species in the world.<br> 
    They live only in Antarctica and are famous for breeding during the harsh winter months.<br>
    Male emperor penguins incubate eggs on their feet under a flap of skin while females hunt for food.<br>
    Their tightly packed huddles help them survive extreme cold and winds.<br> 
    These penguins mainly eat fish, squid, and krill.</b></p>

    <p><b>Adélie Penguins are small black-and-white birds with a distinctive white ring around each eye.<br>
    They live on the Antarctic coast and build stone nests to raise their chicks.<br>
    They are fast swimmers and excellent at dodging predators like leopard seals.<br> 
    These penguins feed mostly on krill, fish, and squid.<br>

    <img src="chapp.jpg">
    <p><b>Chinstrap Penguins are named for the thin black line that runs under their chins, making them look like they're wearing a helmet.<br>
     They nest on rocky slopes and cliffs on islands around Antarctica.<br>
     These penguins are loud and aggressive, especially when defending their nesting sites.<br> 
     Their diet includes mainly krill, but they also eat small fish and squid<br>
    Chinstraps are great swimmers and can dive over 200 feet to find food.</b></p>

    <p><b>Macaroni Penguins have striking yellow-orange feather crests above their eyes, giving them a very unique look.<br>
    They breed on sub-Antarctic islands, not the main continent, but they feed in Antarctic waters.<br>
    These penguins are highly social and nest in extremely large colonies, sometimes with millions of birds<br>.
    They mostly eat krill and other small sea animals. Macaronis are loud and often seen jumping from rock to rock.</b></p>

    <h3>🦭 Weddell Seal</h3>
    <img src="weddel.jpg">
    <p><b>Weddell seals live on fast ice near the Antarctic coastline and are well adapted to the extreme cold.<br>
    They can dive over 600 meters and stay underwater for more than an hour to hunt for fish and squid.<br>
    Their calm nature allows researchers to study them closely.<br>
    Weddell seals use their strong teeth to keep breathing holes open in the ice.<br>
    Their thick blubber and fur protect them from freezing temperatures.</b></p>

    <img src="carrab.jpg">
    <p><b>Crabeater seals are the most numerous large mammals in Antarctica, with millions living around the continent.<br>
    Despite their name, they do not eat crabs—instead, they feed almost entirely on krill.<br>
    Their special teeth filter krill from the water like a sieve.<br>
    They spend most of their time on pack ice and are strong swimmers.<br>
    Crabeater seals are often seen resting in groups on floating ice.</b></p>

    <p><b>Leopard seals are fierce predators with long bodies, powerful jaws, and a reptile-like head.<br>
    They eat penguins, fish, krill, and even other seals, making them top predators in Antarctic waters.<br>
    Unlike other seals, they often hunt alone and are fast, agile swimmers.<br>
    Their loud, eerie underwater calls can be heard through the ice.<br>
    Leopard seals have spotted coats that help them blend with the shadows under the sea.</b></p>

    <img src="🦭 Ross Seal ">
    <p><b>Ross seals are one of the least-known and rarest seals in Antarctica.<br>
    They are short and plump with large, cat-like eyes that help them see in the dark, icy waters.<br>
    Ross seals make strange, sci-fi-like sounds to communicate underwater.<br>
    They live far from research stations, making them hard to observe.<br>
    These seals mostly eat squid and fish and spend a lot of time in the water under heavy sea ice.</b></p>

    it feeds almost entirely on krill, filtering tons of it through its baleen plates daily.<br>
    These gentle giants were once hunted to near extinction but are now protected.<br>
    They migrate to Antarctica in the summer to feed in krill-rich waters.<br>
    Blue whales are rarely seen but their deep songs can travel for miles underwater.</b></p>

    <p><b>Fin whales are the second-largest whale species and are fast swimmers, earning the nickname "the greyhounds of the sea.<br>
    "Like blue whales, they feed on krill and small fish by lunging through schools with their mouths wide open.<br>
    They have a sleek, streamlined body with a distinctive ridge along their back.<br>
    Fin whales are often spotted traveling alone or in pairs.<br>
    They also suffered from past whaling and are slowly recovering in numbers.</b></p>

    <img src="tururu.jpg">
    <p><b>Humpback whales are known for their acrobatic jumps, long flippers, and haunting songs.<br>
    Each summer, they migrate thousands of kilometers to Antarctica to feed on krill.<br>
    They are very social and often seen in groups called pods. Humpbacks use bubble-net feeding, where they blow bubbles to trap prey.<br>
    Their songs, often sung by males, can last for hours and are believed to attract mates.</b></p>

    <p><b>Sei whales are slender and fast, reaching speeds up to 50 km/h.<br>
    they feed near the surface on krill and small fish using their baleen.<br>
    Sei whales were once heavily hunted and are now considered endangered.<br>
    They are rarely seen near the coast and usually stay in deep offshore waters.<br>

    <h3>🐟 Antarctic Toothfish</h3>
    <img src="antarctic.jpg">
    <p><b>The Antarctic toothfish is a large predator that lives in deep, icy waters.<br>
    It plays a key role in the Antarctic food chain and is sometimes called the "shark of the south."<br>
    This fish can grow over 2 meters long and uses fat and antifreeze proteins in its blood to survive freezing temperatures.<br>
    It feeds on smaller fish and squid.<br>
    Because of its size and value, it’s also targeted by fisheries, raising concerns about conservation.</b></p>

    <h3>🐟 Icefish</h3>
    <img src="icefish.jpg">
    <p><b>Icefish are unique for having antifreeze proteins in their blood, which stop their bodies from freezing in subzero temperatures.<br> 
    They have no red blood cells or hemoglobin, making their blood almost clear.<br>
    These fish live near the sea floor and are important food for seals and penguins.<br>
    Their slow movements help conserve energy in the cold. Icefish are found only in the Southern Ocean.</b></p>

    <p><b>Antarctic silverfish are small, silvery fish found in schools near the edge of sea ice.<br>
    They are one of the most important food sources for birds, seals, and whales.<br>
    They spawn under the ice and grow slowly due to the cold.<br>
    Silverfish are sensitive to changes in sea ice, making them a key indicator for climate change.<br>
    Though tiny, they are vital to the Antarctic ecosystem.</b></p>
